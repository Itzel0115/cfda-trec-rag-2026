  // ⑨ 三種模式，差別在「句子撐不住的時候動什麼」—— 這一個選擇就決定了涵蓋要不要付代價。
  //
  //   weaken       改寫成更弱的說法。動的是「過度延伸但有部分支持」的句子，這類很多，
  //                **而且它們正在涵蓋 nugget** —— 寫弱了引用合格、nugget 卻配不上。實測扣涵蓋 8–10pp。
  //   drop         只刪完全沒支持的句子。那些是模型憑空生的，本來就配不到 nugget，
  //                所以傷得比 weaken 小。原作者用這個模式，FS 96.4% / V_strict 0.4137。
  //   reattribute  **一個字都不改**，只改引用：把句子標到 references 裡真正支持它的那一篇；
  //                真的整份證據都不支持才刪。
  //
  // reattribute 的依據是量出來的：純後處理版（tools/split_citations.py --reattribute）
  // 讓 V2 的 FS 18.3%→37.6%，而涵蓋 0.4729→0.4867 **不減反增** —— 因為 nugget 是拿
  // 整篇文字比對的，文字不動涵蓋就不可能掉。這裡把同一件事交給模型做，
  // 它看得到完整證據，判斷會比後處理的詞彙重疊法準得多。

// ── 第二層引用：把各面向的子答案整合成一篇（移植 CFDA 2025）──────────────
//
// 去年 CFDA 的 AG pipeline 是兩層引用：
//   第一層  每個 sub-query s_i 只用它自己的證據池 T_i 寫出 a_i
//   第二層  整合 LLM 產出 y = F(q, {[i]: a_i})，**每句標記它取自哪些 a_i**
//   然後    每句的候選證據 = 它標記到的那些 T_i 的聯集，再逐句驗證支持
//
// 我們只有第一層：各面向的句子直接接起來。這造成兩個問題：
//   1. 讀起來是清單不是文章（面向之間沒有銜接）
//   2. **每句的出處範圍是全題的證據**，而不是「它真正取材的那個面向」——
//      我們量到「只引一篇的句子 FS 也只有 39%」，就是因為句子把多篇揉在一起。
//      標記機制把出處收斂回單一面向的池子，是 FS 天花板的直接解方。
//
// ⚠️ 這一層會**重寫文字**，所以有跟 verify_revise(weaken) 同類的風險：
//    改寫時把具體事實抹平 → nugget 配不上 → 涵蓋掉。prompt 裡因此把
//    「保留每一個具體事實」列為最高優先，並明確禁止摘要與精簡。
